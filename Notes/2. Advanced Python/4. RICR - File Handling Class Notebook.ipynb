    "## Practice Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file named `students.txt` and write the following text into it:  \n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   Alice scored 85 in mathematics.  \n",
    "   Bob scored 78 in science.  \n",
    "   Charlie scored 92 in English.  \n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function to replace every occurrence of a score greater than 80 with the word \"Excellent\" in the file `students.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check whether the word \"science\" exists in the file `students.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function to find the first line where the word \"scored\" appears in the file `students.txt`. Print the line number, or `-1` if the word is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a file `grades.txt` containing grades separated by spaces (e.g., `A B C A D A B`). Write a program to count how many times the grade `A` appears in the file."
